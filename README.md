# Devnagari-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-with-NBC

Naive Bayes algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used for text classification and image recognition tasks. It works on the principle of Bayesian probability and assumes that the features are conditionally independent of each other.

To create a Devanagari Handwritten Character Recognition model using the Naive Bayes algorithm, you can follow these steps:

Preprocessing: Convert the images of the handwritten characters into a suitable format that can be used by the machine learning algorithms. This may involve converting the images into grayscale, resizing them, and normalizing the pixel values.

Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed images that can be used by the machine learning algorithms. Some common features used for character recognition include edge detection, texture analysis.

Data preparation: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model selection: Choose the Naive Bayes algorithm for your task. The algorithm calculates the probabilities of each feature given a specific class and uses these probabilities to predict the class of new samples.

Training: Train the Naive Bayes model using the training dataset and extracted features.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your trained model using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.
